#  Investigating Positive and Negative Qualities of Human-in-the-Loop Optimization for Designing Interaction Techniques (ACM CHI 2022)



## Key Components for the 3D Touch Application
- `BoTorch` directory is the folder of Bayesian optimization codes.
- `BoTorch/mobo.py` is the starting point for Bayesian optimization code execution.
- `python BoTorch/mobo.py` The command start the optimizer which runs 5 initial samples and 35 iterations (40 iterations in total).
- `Assets/Scenes/Designer-led.unity` is the scene to run designer-led condition in unity.
- `Assets/Scenes/MOBO3DTouch.unity` is the scene to run optimizer-led condition in unity.
- `Assets/Resoruces` folder will store all the datas in the design process.
